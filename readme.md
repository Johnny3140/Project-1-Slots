Welcome to my Project 1 
The name of my game is "Leaf Village Slots" which is a basic 3 lane slot machine with a naruto styled theme I chose,
this game because out of the entire list this was the one that seemed the most enjoyable to recreate that will challenge me and let me express a little creativnes in how the slots run and the overall theme of it 
I will be using html, various css styling methods and various JavaScript methods.
The link to the game is here: 

ScreenShots will be provided of different stages of developement below
